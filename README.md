# Dragonhack 2024

Hi, we are team Takle mamo. Our Dragonhack 2024 product is a tool to be used by the Slovenian government and water management agencies, in order to help prevent disastrous floods like the ones that happened in Summer/Fall 2023.

Slovenia is among the countries in Europe with the most aquatic resources. Because of that, it's crucial to keep an overview of the potential water infrastructure maintenance needs. Not taking care of water infrastructure drastically increases the flooding risk of the area. Our tool helps the responsible parties identify and pay attention specifically to the places that are at risk.

The tool utilizes computer vision on the aerial photos of the Slovenian waters, particularly rivers. It analyses the potential blockages that could cause water flow obstructions. We hope that the tool can raise accountability and awareness of the importance of the maintenance of our water bodies.
